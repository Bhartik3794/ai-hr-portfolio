## 📁 Case Study – Workplace Policy Simulation Using Persona Pattern Analysis

This project explores how Generative AI can simulate stakeholder feedback for HR policy testing using the "Persona Pattern" technique.

**Objective:**  
Use AI to analyze the likely reactions of a new graduate hire to a proposed hybrid work policy.

---

### 📌 Prompt Used:
> Act as a new graduate hire in their first corporate job and react to this hybrid work policy with the most common and hardest questions from your perspective:

> ---
> We are pleased to announce that from August 1, 2025, our organization will transition to a hybrid work model. Employees will work on-site for 2 days and remotely for 3 days per week. This aims to balance flexibility with in-person collaboration.  
>
> **Key Points:**
> - Teams will coordinate which days they are in the office.  
> - Office access will be available Mon–Fri from 8 AM to 8 PM.  
> - Internet reimbursement of ₹1,000/month will be provided.  
> - Performance expectations remain unchanged.  
> - Managers will receive training on hybrid team management.

---

### 🧠 AI-Generated Feedback: (New Graduate Hire Perspective)

> *"Thank you for sharing the hybrid work policy. As someone just starting out in the corporate world, I really appreciate the flexibility to work remotely, especially as I adjust to this new phase. That said, since I'm still learning how things work and want to make a good impression, I do have some questions and concerns."*

#### 🔹 Common Questions:
- How will I know which days my team is expected to come in?
- Will it be the same 2 days every week, or will it change?
- What if team members have conflicting preferences?
- Will there be dedicated seating or desks when we come to the office?
- Will new employees like me get more in-person time or mentoring opportunities?
- How will onboarding and training be managed in this hybrid setup?
- What support will be available if I face technical issues while working remotely?
- What happens if I need to come to the office more than 2 days a week?

#### ❗ Hardest Questions:
- How will visibility and performance be measured in a hybrid model?
- How can I ensure I’m noticed and valued as a remote worker?
- How will collaboration work if my manager or teammates pick different office days?
- Will there be any bias toward those who come in more often?
- Could this affect growth, recognition, or future opportunities?
- Will there be structured networking or social events in-office?
- What does “performance expectations remain unchanged” mean in hybrid work?

---

### 💡 Key Takeaways for HR:
- New hires worry about visibility, learning opportunities, and career growth.
- Hybrid scheduling flexibility should be balanced with structured mentoring.
- Communication guidelines are needed to reduce confusion.
- HR should clearly define what “unchanged performance expectations” mean.
