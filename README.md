### üß† AI-Generated Feedback: (New Graduate Hire Perspective)

> *"Thank you for sharing the hybrid work policy. As someone just starting out in the corporate world, I really appreciate the flexibility to work remotely, especially as I adjust to this new phase. That said, since I'm still learning how things work and want to make a good impression, I do have some questions and concerns."*

#### üîπ Common Questions:
- How will I know which days my team is expected to come in?
- Will it be the same 2 days every week, or will it change?
- What if team members have conflicting preferences?
- Will there be dedicated seating or desks when we come to the office?
- Will new employees like me get more in-person time or mentoring opportunities?
- How will onboarding and training be managed in this hybrid setup?
- What support will be available if I face technical issues while working remotely?
- What happens if I need to come to the office more than 2 days a week?

#### ‚ùó Hardest Questions:
- How will visibility and performance be measured in a hybrid model?
- How can I ensure I‚Äôm noticed and valued as a remote worker?
- How will collaboration work if my manager or teammates pick different office days?
- Will there be any bias toward those who come in more often?
- Could this affect growth, recognition, or future opportunities?
- Will there be structured networking or social events in-office?
- What does ‚Äúperformance expectations remain unchanged‚Äù mean in hybrid work?

### üí° Key Takeaways for HR:

- Hybrid scheduling flexibility should be balanced with structured mentoring.
- Communication guidelines are needed to reduce confusion.
- HR should clearly define what ‚Äúunchanged performance expectations‚Äù mean.
